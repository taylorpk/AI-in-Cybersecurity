Artificial Intelligence has grown in popularity very quickly. There is no doubt AI has changed the cybersecurity landscape. 
<p>
AI is being used for hacking, as it helps to write more convincing phishing emails and smarter malware. However, most cybersecurity companies could not have advanced this far without AI. For example, Crowdstrike created its own AI-powered platform named "Falcon", which detects threats faster than humans. Tessian uses AI purely for detecting phishing emails. Without AI, this would not be possible. This project aims to show the impact artificial intelligence is having in the cybersecurity world, both positive and negative.

 This project contains two csv files, a Jupyter Notebook, and Tableau.
### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Navigate into the cloned repo.
3. Create and activate the virtual environment. For instructions on how to create and activate a virtual environment, click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
4. Download requirements.txt.
5. Open and run attack_data.ipynb. This will create a new csv named "merged_attack.csv".
6. Refer to my [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/taylor.kuo/viz/AI-In-Cybersecurity/affecting_cybersecurity#guest=n) dashboard for visualization.

### FEATURES:
1. Read in two data files.
2. Perform a pandas merge with datasets, then calculate new values based on the new data set.
3. Visualize data using Tableau.
4. Utilizing a virtual environment.
5. Comments are included in the Jupyter Notebook.
